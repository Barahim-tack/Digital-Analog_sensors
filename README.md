How to operate digital and analog sensors 

In this repository, two examples of how to use analog and digital sensors. 

I used light detector sensor (LDR) as an analog input with an LED to show how it works. The princple is that it gives a value between 0 - 1024 based on the intensity of the light fallen onto the sensor, and when the value is less than 500, Arduino board turn the Red LED on. 

Moreover, I used infra-red sensor (IR) as an digital input with a buzzer. IR sensor detects any object with a range of 5 cm, so that when there is any object within the range, the buzzer is operated.
